# GoFish
Go fish card game.

Completed demonstrated game logic. No human interaction. Based on finding pairs of cards, like I played as a young child.

I did this in my first year, before learning design patterns (so it's maintainability is poor).

Run demonstration with:

```
javac GameDriver.java

java GameDriver
```
